Iterative Design Notes

SUGGESTIONS
-----------
- Super Mushroom should increase your size, and you should not die with it.
- Bricks should break immediately 
- Display a high score
- Flash screen when invincible
- Jump higher
- Bowser is too hard
- Enemy collision is weird
- Died while 'invincible'
- Mushrooms don't bounce


CHANGES
-------
- Super Mushroom causes you not to die when hit. Size stays the same.
- Brick break with one hit and no longer show destruction in stages.
- Jump height increased when 'Super' player.
- Enemy collision changed for Bullet Bills, Goomba, Koopa. Piranha plants are working as intended.
- Invincibility bug fixed. 
- Mushrooms movement fixed. Bouncing added.

NOTES
-----
None of the easter eggs were discovered during testing. 

Due to the fact that I like these features, and if you happen to read this first, before the code . . . 



*** SPOILER ALERT ***



















































EASTER EGGS
-----------
- On the how to play screen there are small, hard to see instructions just above Yoshi's head.
- In the game typing the word 'konami' allows you to enter no clipping, god mode.
