ACTUAL CLASS*
https://scienceman.googlecode.com/svn-history/r14/trunk/gamelib/game.py

*Note: While the classes are very similar I do not see how I could have really 
	implemented it a different way. However, as the code seems so similar I will
	cite it and leave it to grader's discretion. The rest of the game's code is layed
	out in a similar manner it is a barebones file in my opinion and I did not copy 
	any code from this file. Especially not a globalPlayer.
